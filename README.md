# Semantic Specifications Profile

This specification is a profile, that means that mainly propose a special use / pattern of something existing rather than introducing something entirely new. To follow the specification means following the rules set up. Absolut requirements are expressed with MUST / MUST NOT, strong requirments with SHOULD / SHOULD NOT and finally MAY for weaker recommendations, see [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) for a longer treatment.
